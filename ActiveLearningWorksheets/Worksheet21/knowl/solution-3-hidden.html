<body><div class="solution">First we note that since \(S\) is the flat disk\(x^2+y^2\leq 1\) in the plane \(z=-2\) oriented upward, its orientation will be the vector \(\vec{k}\text{.}\) In particular, only the \(\vec{k}\) component of  vector field \(\vec{F}\) will contribute to the flow through \(S\text{.}\) <ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Since the \(\vec{k}\) component \(z^2\) of \(\vec{F}\) is positive on the surface \(S\)  the vector field \(\vec{F}\) flows with the orientation of \(S\) and thus this integral is positive.</li>
<li>Since the \(\vec{k}\) component \(-3x^2\) of \(\vec{F}\) is negative on the surface \(S\)  the vector field \(\vec{F}\) flows against the orientation of \(S\) and thus this integral is negative.</li>
<li>Since the \(\vec{k}\) component \(-3z\) of \(\vec{F}\) is positive on the surface \(S\) (since \(z=-2\)) the vector field \(\vec{F}\) flows with the orientation of \(S\) and thus this integral is positive.</li>
<li>Since the \(\vec{k}\) component of \(\vec{F}\) is zero on the surface \(S\)  the vector field \(\vec{F}\) does not flow through \(S\) thus this integral is zero.</li>
