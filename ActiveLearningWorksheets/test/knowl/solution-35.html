<p>If \(P(t) \) is the investment's value after \(t \) years, we have \(P(t)=P_{0}e^{ t} \text{.}\) We want to find \(t \) such that \(P(t) \) is  times its initial value, \(P_0 \text{.}\)  Therefore, we need to solve:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
P(t) \amp =  P_0 \\
P_{0}e^{ t} \amp =  P_0 \\
e^{ t} \amp =   \\
\ln e^{ t} \amp = \ln   \\
t \amp = \ln   \\
t \amp = (\ln  )/ \approx  \hbox{ years.} 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>With continuous compounding, the investment should  in about \(\) years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the interest is compounded only once a year, the formula we will use is \(P(t)=P_0b^t \) where \(b \) is the percent value of what the investment had been one year earlier.  If it is earning \(\% \) interest compounded once a year, it is \(10\% \) of what it had been the previous year, so our formula is \(P(t)=P_{0}()^{t}. \)</p>
<p>Using this new formula, we will now solve</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
P(t) \amp =  P_0 \\
P_0()^{t} \amp =  P_{0}  \\
()^{t} \amp =    \\
\log ()^t \amp = \log   \\
t \log  \amp = \log   \\
t \amp = \frac{\log  }{\log }\approx  \hbox{ years.} 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>So, compounding once a year, it will take  \(\) years for the investment to .</p>
