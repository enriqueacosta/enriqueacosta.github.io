      <description>The Illustrative Mathematics Curriculum/Resources are a collection of Mathematics lesson plans, homework practice problems, and family support materials for all K&amp;ndash;12 grades. They were created during the years 2016-2021 and are licensed with the very nice Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license (same as this blog) which allows one to freely share and adapt them as long as one gives due credit. They are very high quality, promoting deep mathematical learning through problem solving, and have been rated very highly by independent non-profit third parties (see here and here).</description>
