      <description>Another Origami post. I got into making Origami diagrams in this other post, and I decided I should attempt to make the instruction diagrams for a flower I invented ages ago!
Making these origami diagrams has allowed me to gain a deeper appreciation for origami diagrams in general. Beautifil art! (Both the origami and the diagrams.)
The diagrams require lots of thought, like:
 how many diagrams are needed (sort of thinking about paragraphs in a text) what should be shown in each diagram adding little &amp;ldquo;3D details&amp;rdquo; to help the &amp;ldquo;readers&amp;rdquo; know they are on the right track lots of &amp;ldquo;hidden&amp;rdquo; geometric reasoing that is not visible in the final product to figure out:  the right dimensions of diagram the correct placement of fold lines (which many times involves bisecting angles) etc.</description>

      <description>While trying to remember how to fold the current long distance record-breaking paper plane, y enden up inventing my own paper plane!
It is pretty similar to the record breaking plane, but it is no exactly the same. I think it has a different balance point, which may make it a better glider (an maybe not long distance record breaking?) It glides very nicely.
These are folding instructions which I created using IPE, an open source verctor image editing software with LaTeX support which I enjoy using.</description>
