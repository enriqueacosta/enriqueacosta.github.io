      <description>The animation above is a gif file that was created with LaTeX and TikZ. I had been trying to do something like this with TikZ unsuccessfully for a long time and I finally figured out how to do it. In this blog post I describe all the steps.
There were two &amp;ldquo;complicated pieces&amp;rdquo; to sort out:
 LaTeX and TikZ do not natively support graphing algebraic curves (implicit plots of the form $f(x,y)=g(x,y)$ with polynomial $f$ and $g$) because it requires precise numerical calculation which LaTeX is not very good at (being a typesetting system, after all).</description>

      <title>TikZ Web Export (pdf to png or svg)</title>

      <description>TikZ is, in very concise terms, a programing language to generate images based on LaTeX. One runs PdfLateX on a TikZ source file (a plain text file) and gets as output a beautiful looking pdf. For a detailed example, you can see this post in which I show the TikZ code of the following image, or this other post in which I go into even more details of the TikZ syntax to create the plot of a function with mathematics LaTeX labels.</description>

      <title>Tikz Figure for a Function With Parameters</title>

      <description>I promised in another post that I would show the code for the TikZ figure I included in that post, reproduced below:
 What is very nice about TikZ and its pfgplots package is that the curve in the figure is really a logistic curve, and not just a Bezier curve, or a spline that attempts to mimic the shape of a logistic. Specifically, the function whose graph shows up in the figure is given by $$ f(t) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-4(x-2.</description>

      <title>Tikz 3D - Twisted Cubic</title>
      <link>https://enriqueacosta.github.io/blog/en/posts/tikz-twisted-cubic/</link>

      <description>As Joe Harris mentions in his book &amp;ldquo;Algebraic Geometry: A First Course&amp;rdquo;, the Twisted Cubic is &amp;ldquo;everybody&amp;rsquo;s first example of a concrete variety that is not a hypersurface, linear space, or finite set of points.&amp;rdquo;
In affine space, it is given by the image of $$t\mapsto(t,t^2,t^3).$$
As I was working through all the exercises in the book (I still am!) I decided that I wanted to make a Tikz picture for it (to learn to do 3D figures in Tikz).</description>
