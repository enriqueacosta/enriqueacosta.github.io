      <description>This is a follow-up to a previous post describing how I set up this blog. Here I describe a couple of extra pieces of the setup including more elaborate multilingual support, the creation of a multilingual footer for all posts, and the about page.
Multilingual Text &amp;ldquo;Snippets&amp;rdquo; Using i18n Hugo comes built in with with a very nice and simple way to specify fixed texts that should change according to the language.</description>

      <description>This blog does not live in a commercial platform for bloggers. It is what is technically called a &amp;ldquo;static site&amp;rdquo;, meaning it is just a collection of html files that are linked between each other and some other formatting files (css, for example). As such, it can be hosted anywhere and is not tied to any particular platform. Moreover, it was created with a fantastic open source tool caled Hugo. In this blog entry I explain how I set it up.</description>
