      <description>Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic started, the subject of interpreting a Covid-19 test results has been coming back to bite me over and over again.
I knew the fact that the probability of a Covid-19 test result giving the correct information depends on the portion of the population that is infected at that moment, but I did not know the details or understand why this could be the case. Every time I tried to read about this I ended up reading articles with lots of tables with made-up numbers that did not help me gain any clarity or understanding on the matter.</description>

      <title>Mauna Loa CO2 Growing Super-Exponentially?</title>

      <description>As part of my work with the Mathematics Consortium Working Group (currently creating data-related activities for our Applied Calculus book), I discovered that $\text{CO}_2$ concentration, measured at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii since the 1950s, can be modeled surprisingly well by a &amp;ldquo;super-exponential&amp;rdquo; function of the form $$f(t)=P_0(b+mt)^t.$$
Then, while convinced of how alarming and serious this was (super-exponential growth is as alarming as it sounds), I discovered one could also fit an &amp;ldquo;almost exponential&amp;rdquo; model which assumes exponential growth not from $0$, but from a base level $C$ instead, like this: $$g(t)= C+Ba^{t}.</description>

      <title>Tikz Figure for a Function With Parameters</title>
      <link>https://enriqueacosta.github.io/blog/en/posts/tikz-family-of-functions/</link>

      <description>I promised in another post that I would show the code for the TikZ figure I included in that post, reproduced below:
 What is very nice about TikZ and its pfgplots package is that the curve in the figure is really a logistic curve, and not just a Bezier curve, or a spline that attempts to mimic the shape of a logistic. Specifically, the function whose graph shows up in the figure is given by $$ f(t) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-4(x-2.</description>

      <title>Covid-19 Delta Variant % Share of Cases Grew Logistically</title>
      <link>https://enriqueacosta.github.io/blog/en/posts/covid-delta-variant-logisitc/</link>

      <description>Today, as part of my work, I stumbled upon the surprising fact that in many countries the % share of Covid-19 cases that were Delta variant grew almost perfectly logistically from 0% to 100% during 2021.
The graph below, which started all of this, should come up if one follows this Our World In Data link.

      <title>Tikz 3D - Twisted Cubic</title>
      <link>https://enriqueacosta.github.io/blog/en/posts/tikz-twisted-cubic/</link>

      <description>As Joe Harris mentions in his book &amp;ldquo;Algebraic Geometry: A First Course&amp;rdquo;, the Twisted Cubic is &amp;ldquo;everybody&amp;rsquo;s first example of a concrete variety that is not a hypersurface, linear space, or finite set of points.&amp;rdquo;
In affine space, it is given by the image of $$t\mapsto(t,t^2,t^3).$$
As I was working through all the exercises in the book (I still am!) I decided that I wanted to make a Tikz picture for it (to learn to do 3D figures in Tikz).</description>
