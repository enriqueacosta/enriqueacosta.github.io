      <description>This blog does not live in a commercial platform for bloggers. It is what is technically called a &amp;ldquo;static site&amp;rdquo;, meaning it is just a collection of html files that are linked between each other and some other formatting files (css, for example). As such, it can be hosted anywhere and is not tied to any particular platform. Moreover, it was created with a fantastic open source tool caled Hugo. In this blog entry I explain how I set it up.</description>

      <title>Tikz 3D - Twisted Cubic</title>

      <description>As Joe Harris mentions in his book &amp;ldquo;Algebraic Geometry: A First Course&amp;rdquo;, the Twisted Cubic is &amp;ldquo;everybody&amp;rsquo;s first example of a concrete variety that is not a hypersurface, linear space, or finite set of points.&amp;rdquo;
In affine space, it is given by the image of $$t\mapsto(t,t^2,t^3).$$
As I was working through all the exercises in the book (I still am!) I decided that I wanted to make a Tikz picture for it (to learn to do 3D figures in Tikz).</description>
