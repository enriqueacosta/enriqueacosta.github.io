      I recently remembered the very cool Arrecibo message and I discovered the Wikipedia article on it is truly fantastic. After reading about the meaning of all its parts of the message, I decided I wanted a printed copy for my home. In this post I describe how I generated the print-ready image file.
Here is the message:

      This is a follow-up to a previous post describing how I set up this blog. Here I describe a couple of extra pieces of the setup including more elaborate multilingual support, the creation of a multilingual footer for all posts, and the about page.
Multilingual Text &ldquo;Snippets&rdquo; Using i18n Hugo comes built in with with a very nice and simple way to specify fixed texts that should change according to the language.

      I was recently invited to participate in a webinar as the lead Spanish translator of the Illustrative Mathematics K-8 Curriculum (see here). The main point they wanted me to discuss was what was our process translating the resources, and why a simple word-for-word translation like that could be put into Google insufficient.
As a preparation for this webinar, I decided to write this blog entry describing detailed answers to this prompt.

      I promised in another post that I would show the code for the TikZ figure I included in that post, reproduced below:
 What is very nice about TikZ and its pfgplots package is that the curve in the figure is really a logistic curve, and not just a Bezier curve, or a spline that attempts to mimic the shape of a logistic. Specifically, the function whose graph shows up in the figure is given by $$ f(t) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-4(x-2.

      Today, as part of my work, I stumbled upon the surprising fact that in many countries the % share of Covid-19 cases that were Delta variant grew almost perfectly logistically from 0% to 100% during 2021.
The graph below, which started all of this, should come up if one follows this Our World In Data link.

      This blog does not live in a commercial platform for bloggers. It is what is technically called a &ldquo;static site&rdquo;, meaning it is just a collection of html files that are linked between each other and some other formatting files (css, for example). As such, it can be hosted anywhere and is not tied to any particular platform. Moreover, it was created with a fantastic open source tool caled Hugo. In this blog entry I explain how I set it up.

      As Joe Harris mentions in his book &ldquo;Algebraic Geometry: A First Course&rdquo;, the Twisted Cubic is &ldquo;everybody&rsquo;s first example of a concrete variety that is not a hypersurface, linear space, or finite set of points.&rdquo;
In affine space, it is given by the image of $$t\mapsto(t,t^2,t^3).$$
As I was working through all the exercises in the book (I still am!) I decided that I wanted to make a Tikz picture for it (to learn to do 3D figures in Tikz).
