        TikZ is a programing language for creating images based on LaTeX. One writes TikZ &ldquo;programing code&rdquo; in a plain text file, and gets as output a pdf image file. The TikZ programming language was thought out to enable the code for a figure to be surprisingly human-readable. What I mean by this is that the reader can imagine the figure from the code because it looks like &ldquo;drawing instructions for a human&rdquo; instead of a bunch of obscure commands with lots hard to imagine numbers and coordinates.

        Here is a cool animation I made in 2012.
The animation shows the complex zeros of the Taylor polynomials of the exponential function $e^z$. In this post I will explain what this means, and why it is interesting. I will also show the code in Sage to recreate the animation (which I originaly created in Mathematica in 2012). Unlike Mathematica, which is not free or open source, Sage is a Python-based open source mathematics software system that builds on top of many existing open-source packages.

        In this post, I will show how I recreated a beautiful figure with spirals from a math-inspired coloring book using complex functions and Möbius transformations.
Here is the figure:
Page from Patterns of the Universe Coloring book by Alex Bellos and Edmund Harris.
Here is one of my son&rsquo;s coloring of the curvy grid!
I find the figure mesmerizing with its slight lack of total symmetry, spirals that go in opposite directions, and intersecting bendy curves at right angles.

        The animation above is a gif file that was created with LaTeX and TikZ. I had been trying to do something like this with TikZ unsuccessfully for a long time and I finally figured out how to do it. In this blog post I describe all the steps.
There were two &ldquo;complicated pieces&rdquo; to sort out:
LaTeX and TikZ do not natively support graphing algebraic curves (implicit plots of the form $f(x,y)=g(x,y)$ with polynomial $f$ and $g$) because it requires precise numerical calculation which LaTeX is not very good at (being a typesetting system, after all).

        Another Origami post. I got into making Origami diagrams in this other post, and I decided I should attempt to make the instruction diagrams for a flower I invented ages ago!
Making these origami diagrams has allowed me to gain a deeper appreciation for origami diagrams in general. Beautiful art! (Both the origami and the diagrams!)
I now realize that lots of thought goes into making these diagrams. Like for example,

        While trying to remember how to fold the current long distance record-breaking paper plane, y ended up inventing my own paper plane!
It is pretty similar to the record breaking plane, but it is no exactly the same. I think it has a different balance point, which may make it a better glider (an maybe not long distance record breaking?) It glides very nicely.
These are folding instructions which I created using IPE, an open source vector image editing software with LaTeX support which I enjoy using.

        TikZ is, in very concise terms, a programing language to generate images based on LaTeX. One runs PdfLateX on a TikZ source file (a plain text file) and gets as output a beautiful looking pdf. For a detailed example, you can see this post in which I show the TikZ code of the following image, or this other post in which I go into even more details of the TikZ syntax to create the plot of a function with mathematics LaTeX labels.

        Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic started, the subject of interpreting a Covid-19 test results has been coming back to bite me over and over again.
I knew the fact that the probability of a Covid-19 test result giving the correct information depends on the portion of the population that is infected at that moment, but I did not know the details or understand why this could be the case. Every time I tried to read about this I ended up reading articles with lots of tables with made-up numbers that did not help me gain any clarity or understanding on the matter.

        As part of my work with the Mathematics Consortium Working Group (currently creating data-related activities for our Applied Calculus book), I discovered that $\text{CO}_2$ concentration, measured at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii since the 1950s, can be modeled surprisingly well by a &ldquo;super-exponential&rdquo; function of the form $$f(t)=P_0(b+mt)^t.$$
Then, while convinced of how alarming and serious this was (super-exponential growth is as alarming as it sounds), I discovered one could also fit an &ldquo;almost exponential&rdquo; model which assumes exponential growth not from $0$, but from a base level $C$ instead, like this: $$g(t)= C+Ba^{t}.

        I was recently invited to participate in a webinar as the lead Spanish translator of the Illustrative Mathematics K-8 Curriculum (see here). The main point they wanted me to discuss was what was our process translating the resources, and why a simple word-for-word translation like that could be put into Google insufficient.
As a preparation for this webinar, I decided to write this blog entry describing detailed answers to this prompt.

        I promised in another post that I would show the code for the TikZ figure I included in that post, reproduced below:
What is very nice about TikZ and its pfgplots package is that the curve in the figure is really a logistic curve, and not just a Bezier curve, or a spline that attempts to mimic the shape of a logistic. Specifically, the function whose graph shows up in the figure is given by $$ f(t) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-4(x-2.

        As Joe Harris mentions in his book &ldquo;Algebraic Geometry: A First Course&rdquo;, the Twisted Cubic is &ldquo;everybody&rsquo;s first example of a concrete variety that is not a hypersurface, linear space, or finite set of points.&rdquo;
In affine space, it is given by the image of $$t\mapsto(t,t^2,t^3).$$
As I was working through all the exercises in the book (I still am!) I decided that I wanted to make a Tikz picture for it (to learn to do 3D figures in Tikz).
