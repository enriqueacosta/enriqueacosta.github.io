      <description>Another Origami post. I got into making Origami diagrams in this other post, and I decided I should attempt to make the instruction diagrams for a flower I invented ages ago!
Making these origami diagrams has allowed me to gain a deeper appreciation for origami diagrams in general. Beautiful art! (Both the origami and the diagrams!)
I now realize that lots of thought goes into making these diagrams. Like for example,</description>

      <description>While trying to remember how to fold the current long distance record-breaking paper plane, y ended up inventing my own paper plane!
It is pretty similar to the record breaking plane, but it is no exactly the same. I think it has a different balance point, which may make it a better glider (an maybe not long distance record breaking?) It glides very nicely.
These are folding instructions which I created using IPE, an open source vector image editing software with LaTeX support which I enjoy using.</description>
