  <p>Ever since the pandemic started, the subject of interpreting a Covid-19 test result has been coming back to bite me over and over again. I knew that the probability of a Covid-19 test result giving the correct information depends on the portion of the population that is infected at that moment, but every time I tried to read about this I ended up reading articles with lots of tables with made-up numbers that did not help me  gain any clarity or understanding on the matter.</p>
<p>I finally found an <a href="https://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fc-2020-09">AMS Column</a> by Bill Casselman that got me a bit closer to understanding, and in this post I give a brief summary, provide some extra explanations, and show some nice interactive plots that I made to play around with the ideas in the column.</p>

<p>Before going any further, I need to establish some terminology.</p>
<h3 id="some-terminology">Some terminology</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Covid-19 test may give a positive result when the person is not infected. This is called a <em>false positive</em>.</li>
<li>Similarly, a Covid-19 test may negative result when the person is in fact infected infected. This is called a <em>false negative</em>.</li>
<li>The two remaining cases are when the test tells the truth. These are the <em>true positive</em> and <em>true negative</em>.</li>
<li>Which of these is more important depends on who you are and what you are worrying about, but from a soscietal perspective, the false negatives most definitely are the most serious ones: they make people think they are not infected when they in fact are and increase the chances of them spreading the disease.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="dont-believe-a-test-saying-guaranteed-to-have-less-than-1-false-negatives">Don&rsquo;t believe a test saying &ldquo;Guaranteed to have less than 1% false negatives!&rdquo;</h3>
<p>A natural assumption is to believe that the percentage of each of these cases (false negatives, true positives, etc.) depends on the quality of the test:</p>
<ul>
<li>a high quality test has few false negatives, and few false positives.</li>
<li>a low quality test has more false negatives, and more false positives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the thing is, this is not entirely true! The percentage of each case depends on the population that one is testing and the moment of time one is doing it. One cannot look at the specification sheet of a PCR Covid-19 test and read &ldquo;Guaranteed to have less than 1% false negatives!&rdquo;. A statement like this simply cannot be given.</p>
<p>Wrapping one&rsquo;s head around this fact, and understanding why it is so is the content of the <a href="https://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fc-2020-09">AMS Column</a> by Bill Casselman that I mentioned above.</p>
<p>I will try my best to be self contained in what follows, I encourage whoever reads this post to go ahead and read the column. The author really does a fantastic job at explaining the phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="pre-test-probability">Pre-test probability</h3>
<p>Explain that it is not the portion of the population. More like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What % of the population has Covid-19 right now? (not the reported one, but the true expected one).</li>
<li>This is the first pre-test probability that anyone will have Covid-19.</li>
<li>Does the person have symptoms? This increases the pre-test probability.</li>
<li>Has the person been in contact with someone with symptoms or that who has tested positive. This increases the pre-test probability.</li>
<li>This is an aproximation to the pre-test probability. With it, one can now look at the test result and interpret the result accordingly.</li>
</ul>
