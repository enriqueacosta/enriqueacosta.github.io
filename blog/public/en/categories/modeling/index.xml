      <description>As part of my work with the Mathematics Consortium Working Group (currently creating data-related activities for our Applied Calculus book), I discovered that $\text{CO}_2$ concentration, measured at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii since the 1950s, can be modeled surprisingly well by a &amp;ldquo;super-exponential&amp;rdquo; function of the form $$f(t)=P_0(b+mt)^t.$$
Then, while convinced of how alarming and serious this was (super-exponential growth is as alarming as it sounds), I discovered one could also fit an &amp;ldquo;almost exponential&amp;rdquo; model which assumes exponential growth not from $0$, but from a base level $C$ instead, like this: $$g(t)= C+Ba^{t}.</description>

      <description>Today, as part of my work, I stumbled upon the surprising fact that in many countries the % share of Covid-19 cases that were Delta variant grew almost perfectly logistically from 0% to 100% during 2021.
The graph below, which started all of this, should come up if one follows this Our World In Data link.
